# placebot

**WARNING: ONLY REDDIT ACCOUNTS WITH VERIFIED EMAIL ARE SUPPORTED.** If your account has a 20 minutes rate limit, this will not work well.

## How to use

1) Use a chromium based browser
2) Log in to reddit
3) Go to your extension page (chrome://extensions/)
4) Load the unpacked extension. You might have to enable developer mode
5) Click on "service worker" to inspect it and leave that window opened in the background
6) Go to /r/place
7) You should see an alert message saying the bot is running. If it doesn't work, make sure you did step 5 correctly.

## Use multiple accounts

You can use multiple accounts by opening multiple browser windows in private mode.
